# Derivatives
In this repository you can find calibration of three models:
  1) Merton's Jump Diffusion, 1976 (MJD). Both for 1 time (Fitting on IV) and for 3 time intervals simultaneously (Fitting on volatility surface)
  2) Heston Model, 1993 (SV). Both for 1 time (Fitting on IV) and for 3 time intervals simultaneously (Fitting on volatility surface)
  3) Bates Model, 1996 (SVJ). Both for 1 time (Fitting on IV) and for 3 time intervals simultaneously (Fitting on volatility surface)

Moreover, here you can find Monte Carlo realization of these models too

In this project I used a lot http://gouthamanbalaraman.com/blog/quantlib-python-tutorials-with-examples.html and material/books from Yves Hilpisch (Python for finance, Derivatives Analytics with Python: Data Analysis, Models, Simulation, Calibration and Hedging (The Wiley Finance Series)). In this books you can find main ideas and code too.
